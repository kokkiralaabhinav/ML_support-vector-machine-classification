# ML_support-vector-machine-classification
Support Vector Machine(SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. Though we say regression problems as well its best suited for classification. The objective of SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points.

## What is SVM classifier used for:-
SVMs are used in applications like handwriting recognition, intrusion detection, face detection, email classification, gene classification, and in web pages. This is one of the reasons we use SVMs in machine learning. It can handle both classification and regression on linear and non-linear data.

## What are the advantages of SVM in ML:-
SVMs have several advantages, such as the ability to handle high-dimensional data and the ability to perform well with small datasets. They also have the ability to model non-linear decision boundaries, which can be very useful in many applications.

## working principle of SVM:-
SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable. A separator between the categories is found, then the data are transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane.

##the properties of SVM:-
Their "fame" mainly rests on two key properties: 

1) SVMs find solutions of classification problems that have "generalization in mind".
2) they are able to find non-linear solutions efficiently using the "kernel trick".
